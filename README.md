# NLP_Explore

### Project Objective
The goal of this project is to explore some of the R packages associated with Natural Language Processing and build some topic models and word clouds utilizing the [**State of the Union addresses**](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/presidential-documents-archive-guidebook/annual-messages-congress-the-state-the-union. We will attempt to determine how the sentiment of SOTU addresses changes over time, whether there is a meaningful difference in sentiment for [**Republican vs Democratic parties**](https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/articles/teaching-content/timeline-guide-us-presidents/, and if topic modeling can classify recent addresses by political party.
